          <h2>The Future of the Universe</h2>
          <img src="img/main.png" alt="universe" />
          <p>
            Let us look at the future of the Universe to understand what will
            become of the stars in the long term and what would be the
            possibilities of survival in a universe that will become colder and
            whose energy resources will be exhausted.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our tool is the Big Bang theory that describes not only the past of
            the universe but also its future. Taking place in eons that are in
            multiples of billions of billions of years or even more, we can
            assume that no one will be there to describe what is really
            happening or to rectify our assumptions.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, intellectually the future is always an exciting subject,
            even if by nature it is close to science fiction with all the
            possible slippages. But by strictly and simply applying the laws of
            physics and thermodynamics, this future remains predictable despite
            a certain margin of inaccuracy related to the properties of stars
            and processes that have a wide range of features including functions
            mass and body temperature.
